# RideEase was developed as part of the Tutedude Web Development Hackathon. This project offers a streamlined vehicle rental experience, featuring an intuitive design, robust booking functionality, and easy navigation. The aim was to create a user-friendly platform that meets modern web standards while providing a seamless experience for customers. Special thanks to Tutedude for organizing the hackathon and providing an opportunity to showcase and enhance web development skills.
